## Biological Scope
* Plants don’t have immune systems the way other organisms and mammals have
* There’s an evolutionary arms race between evolving resistance and the pathogen evolving to escape this detection
* NBS (nucleotide binding site) + LRR (leucine-rich repeats) domains widely-conserved and well-studied regions of plant genomes
* LRR and NBS domains are relatively conserved (despite the rapid evolutionary pressure on plant defense genes)
* These NBS-LRR (R genes) act as the immune systems in plants
* They typically cluster in the same regions and evolve quickly
* The more R genes plants have, the more likely they can defend against threats
* Plants don’t have antibodies
* These genes are transcribed and they’re then used in RNAinterference; there’s hairpins in the genes and they have some regions which target the pathogen sequences

## Benchmarking Goals
Work together today across 4 timezones to get our DNAnexus workspace booted up and the general pipeline implemented

## Finetuning Experiments
Actively discussing and planning finetuning experiments to bring our project home by the hackathon's end
